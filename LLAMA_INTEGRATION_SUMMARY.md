# 🦁 LMU Campus LLM - Llama Integration Complete!

## ✅ What We've Built

Your LMU Campus LLM app now has a fully integrated, authentic GenZ chatbot that sounds like a real LMU student! Here's what's working:

### 🎯 **Authentic GenZ Voice**
- **Natural slang usage**: "fr", "bet", "lowkey", "nah for real", "vibes", "idk tbh", "lemme check"
- **Casual tone matching**: Responds in the same energy as the user
- **Concise responses**: No fluff, just real info
- **Effective emoji usage**: 👀 for interest, 😭 for relatable struggles, 💀 for humor

### 🏫 **LMU-Specific Knowledge**
- **Campus spots**: The Bluff, U-Hall, Burns Backcourt, The Lair, C-Store, Sunken Garden, Gersten
- **Student life**: Lion Dollars, First Fridays, late-night C-Store runs, Greek row
- **Events**: Basketball games at Gersten, tailgates, mixers, study sessions
- **Food culture**: "The Lair pizza hits different at 2am fr 🍕"
- **School spirit**: LMU Lions pride, crimson & navy everything

### 🤖 **Smart Integration Features**
- **Fallback system**: Works even when Llama model is offline
- **Conversation history**: Remembers context from previous messages
- **Model status detection**: Shows "Llama Powered" vs "Fallback Mode"
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful responses

## 🚀 **Current Responses (Fallback Mode)**

### Food Questions
```
User: "whats the best food on campus?"
Bot: "The Lair pizza hits different at 2am fr 🍕 fries are *chef's kiss* too. Den has fire chicken tenders if you're feeling that vibe. Pro tip: bring your student ID for the discount!"
```

### Greek Life
```
User: "how do i join greek life?"
Bot: "Greek life mixer this Friday at the Sunken Garden, should be lit 🔥 rush week in the spring is a whole vibe. each house has their own personality fr. my friend Sarah just joined Alpha Phi and she's living her best life. dm me if you want the tea on specific houses 👀"
```

### Study Spots
```
User: "where should i study?"
Bot: "U-Hall 3rd floor has the best views and is usually quieter. Den has great vibes if you want background noise, new student center has these amazing pods perfect for group study sessions. my secret spot? rooftop of the business building - so aesthetic and peaceful! 📚"
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Backend (`backend/llama_integration.py`)

- **Fallback responses**: LMU-specific, GenZ-voiced backup responses

### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/BuddyChat.js`)

### API Endpoints
