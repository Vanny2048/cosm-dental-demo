### 🎯 **Real Response Examples**

#### Food Question
```
User: "whats the best food on campus?"
Bot: "OMG 👀 like, have you tried the pizza at The Lair? It's literally to die for 💀 Like, I know it's late night, but trust me, it's worth staying up for 😩 idk tbh, maybe you should try the sushi at Gersten? It's hella good too 🍣 But honestly, the best food on campus is whatever makes you happy, fam 💕"
```

#### Study Spots
```
User: "where should i study?"
Bot: "Oh wow, you wanna know where to study? 👀 Well, let me tell ya, there are some sick spots on campus! 💪 Have you tried The Bluff? It's like, the perfect spot to get lost in your thoughts and hustle through those exams. 📚 Or, you know, you could always hit up U-Hall for a chill study sesh. 😎 Just make sure you don't fall asleep during lecture, ya feel? 😴

But honestly, my dude, I'm not sure where the best spot is. That's above my pay grade, man! 😭 You should probably check the ASLMU Insta or somethin' to see what other students are vibin' with. 🤔 Just don't forget to hit up the C-Store for some grub to fuel that study session! 🍕👌 Lowkey hope you crush those exams, my dude!"
