# Netlify Form Detection Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
Your form has been updated with the following fixes:

1. ✅ Changed `data-netlify="true"` to `netlify` attribute
2. ✅ Added `action="/"` to the form
3. ✅ Added a hidden static form for Netlify detection
4. ✅ Temporarily removed JavaScript interference
5. ✅ Created a simple test form (`simple-form-test.html`)

## Step-by-Step Testing Process

### 1. Deploy and Test the Simple Form

1. **Deploy your site to Netlify**
2. **Visit your site and go to `/simple-form-test.html`**
3. **Submit the simple form**
4. **Check your Netlify dashboard** under Forms → Submissions

### 2. Check Form Detection

1. **Go to your Netlify dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Forms section**
3. **Look for forms named:**
   - `simple-contact` (from the test page)
   - `contact` (from your main form)

### 3. Test the Main Form

1. **Go to your main site**
2. **Navigate to the contact section**
3. **Submit the form**
4. **Check for submissions in Netlify dashboard**

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Forms Not Appearing in Netlify Dashboard

**Symptoms:** No forms listed in the Forms section of your Netlify dashboard

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for deployment**: Forms are detected at build time, not runtime
2. **Check build logs**: Look for any build errors
3. **Verify form syntax**: Ensure `netlify` attribute is present
4. **Clear cache**: Sometimes Netlify caches old builds

### Issue 2: Form Submissions Not Received

**Symptoms:** Forms appear in dashboard but submissions don't come through

**Solutions:**
1. **Check form action**: Should be `action="/"` or no action
2. **Verify form method**: Should be `method="POST"`
3. **Check for JavaScript errors**: Console errors can prevent submission
4. **Test without JavaScript**: Temporarily remove `onsubmit` handlers

### Issue 3: JavaScript Interference

**Symptoms:** Form works without JavaScript but fails with it

**Solutions:**
1. **Use event listeners instead of inline handlers**:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('leadForm').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
       // Your form handling code
   });
   ```

2. **Allow default submission as fallback**:
   ```javascript
   function submitForm(event) {
       // Your custom logic
       
       // If custom logic fails, allow default
       if (customLogicFailed) {
           return true; // Allow default form submission
       }
   }
   ```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy site to Netlify
- [ ] Check Forms section in Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Test simple form at `/simple-form-test.html`
- [ ] Test main contact form
- [ ] Verify submissions appear in dashboard
- [ ] Check for any console errors
- [ ] Test form without JavaScript

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the current changes**
2. **Test the simple form first**
3. **If simple form works, test the main form**
4. **If main form doesn't work, re-enable JavaScript gradually**

## Re-enabling JavaScript (After Form Works)

Once the form is detected and working, you can re-enable the JavaScript:

1. **Add back the `onsubmit` handler**:
   ```html
   <form ... onsubmit="submitForm(event)">
   ```

2. **Update the JavaScript to work with Netlify**:
   ```javascript
   function submitForm(event) {
       // Your custom logic here
       
       // After custom logic, allow Netlify to handle the submission
       return true;
   }
   ```

## Debugging Commands

To check if your site is properly deployed:

```bash
# Check if your site is live
curl -I https://your-site-name.netlify.app

# Check for any build errors in Netlify logs
# (Check your Netlify dashboard → Deploys → Latest deploy → Build log)
```

## Contact Netlify Support

If none of the above solutions work:

1. **Check Netlify status page**: https://status.netlify.com
2. **Contact Netlify support**: https://www.netlify.com/support/
3. **Include in your support request**:
   - Your site URL
   - Form HTML code
   - Build logs
   - Steps you've already tried

## Expected Timeline

- **Form detection**: Should happen within 1-2 minutes after deployment
- **First submission**: Should appear in dashboard within 1-2 minutes
- **Subsequent submissions**: Should appear immediately

If forms aren't detected after 5 minutes, there's likely a configuration issue.
